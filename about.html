    <h1>hico heritage</h1>
    Hico is Pakistans first ice cream company. Established in 1952, we now offer many more flavors in many more locations across the country. Ever since, we have been devoted to making the best ice cream in Pakistan for you
We manufacture 100% pure dairy ice cream. Our ice cream is made from dairy ingredients such as fresh cream and milk, is free of vegetable oil, and contains no saturated fats. We only procure the freshest and purest ingredients to make the best quality ice cream.
Founded in 1952, Hico was the first ice cream cream company in Pakistan. The operation started as a small tricycle vending business with hawkers roaming the city of Lahore. The Hico jingle attracted both children and adults to devour what was at that time, Pakistans only ice cream company.
Over the years, the operation slowly, but steadily expanded. In the early 2000s the business was industrialized, with a shift of focus from distributing products through tricycle vending to selling them at retail stores. This shift brought about a massive increase in demand, compelling the organization to completely overhaul its supply chain. Small batch operations were transformed into faster and more efficient continuous processes. Warehouses and distribution hubs were opened in the major Pakistani cities. Refrigerated reefer vans were procured to ensure that the ice cream stayed at the optimal temperature from factory to warehouse to retail outlet.
Hico is now available in 10,000+ outlets across Pakistan, and is aggressively expanding to new cities. From a production capacity of a few hundred liters in the early 2000s, we now have a production capacity of over 100,000 liters per day. Our goal remains the same: produce the best quality dairy ice cream in the country.
